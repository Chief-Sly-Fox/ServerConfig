      - I would like to help out the server alot and I would do anything I could to
        help out like get more players, or help players out, Anything you need. I
        would also like to be part of the staff team because I like helping people
        out with servers.
      - I know you probably wont accept this because its probably not the best one
        you've gotten, but atleast I have tried to apply to get Co-Owner. I would
        love to be this servers Co-Owner, and take care of this server regularly.
        I will also be very active.
      - I will be online most of the days of the weekdays and alot on the weekends.
